  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <p> My short term goal is to become fit and a good programmer at the end of the college.<br />
    And my long term goal is to get a job in a good company.
    I set my goals on the basis of how I want to progress or move through my life.<br />
    I want to feel a sense of accomplishment and self-worth by completing my daily goals and my short, long term goals.</p>

  <h3>Acheivements and Shortcomings</h3>
  <p>My achievements are that I have cleared the first round of Space Olympiad 2014 securing the 2nd position in the whole school.<br>
    In 10+1 I have also cleared the Science Olympiad with a good rank.<br>
    Then, I have cleared the JEE mains exams and got admission into DAVIET, Jalandhar<br>
    And In college I have been promoted to Co-head of the photography club CLICKER.<br><br>
    My shortcoming is my habit of procrastination. I complete mine work and studies within time period and achieve good scores but there is always a regret what if I had done this thing earlier and in a right way and then would have got a much better
    results.<br>
    I am trying to overcome this habit of mine.<br> But this regret of not able to understand myself truly is mine failure and the ones who aren’t able to acknowledge their own selves are bound to fail.<br><br>
    <strong>ANALYSIS OF MINE SHORTCOMINGS:</strong><br> From all of this mine shortcomings I have learned different kind of things and one of them is that everyone should accept and acknowledge and appreciate themselves for what kind of person they
    are and they
    were.<br>
    If we just forgive and accept ourselves than we don’t have to lie to ourselves. If we lie to ourselves then how can we be trustworthy or have friends who put their trust on us.<br>
    In the end, all these lies will keep us from seeing our true self.
